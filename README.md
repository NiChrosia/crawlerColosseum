# Crawler Colosseum

A mindustry plugin based off of ilya246's crawler_arena.  

By default, this requires `crawler-colosseum.msav` in the maps directory, as well as automatically hosting a game upon loading.  
This behavior can be disabled by running `autohost false` in the console, and to re-enable, `autohost true`.
